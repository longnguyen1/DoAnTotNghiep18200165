1. **Escape Special Characters in SQL Queries**: 
    - It's important to escape special characters in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. You can use prepared statements or parameterized queries to achieve this.

2. **Undefined Constants**: 
    - The constants `HOST`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, and `DB` are used in the constructor but are not defined within the class. You need to define these constants or pass them as arguments to the constructor.

3. **Syntax Errors**:
    - In the `delete` method, there is a variable mismatch (`$query` instead of `$sql`) when executing the delete query.

4. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**:
    - The `create` and `update` methods construct SQL queries directly from user input without sanitization. Consider using prepared statements or escaping values properly.

5. **Incorrect Array Handling**:
    - In the `whereIn`
